When we launch the application, we arrive in this page :

Once we clicked on the "Get astronauts" this page is displayed :

We can click on any of the astronauts and get their picture, name, location and description.

Unfortunatelly I had an issue with this astronaut, I wasn't able to display his picture :

Once clicked here is the result without the picture :

To create all of this, I changed the classes of the monkey.cs file :

And here is how i modified the json file to add all the informations about the astronauts :

You can also see I changed the colors of the application, here is how :

When don't have internet connection, this pop-up appears to say that the informations cannot be displayed because of it :

Warning, to launch the application, the part 6 needs to be replaced in the orignial repository. (Due to git confrontation)
